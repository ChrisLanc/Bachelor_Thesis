### The Impact of Demographic Change on Inflation Dynamics – An Empirical Analysis –



This code constitutes the econometric panel data analysis of puplicaly available datasets in R:

1. The UN World Population Prospects The 2015 Revision
2. The Total Economic Database
3. The World Developement Indicator Dataset from the World Bank

## Procedure

This work attempts to analyze the effects of changes in the demographic structure of countries on the inflationary dynamics of the CPI. Especially focusing on the 
comparison between developed OECD countries and a wide sample of emerging countries

1. Harmonize and clean the data to merge the different datasets
2. Preprocess relevant variables (Category Dummies, Growth Rates, Deseasonalization etc..) to prepare the fixed effects panel regression
3. Run the fixed effects panel regression in various specifications to gauge the relevance and robustness of the impact on inflation dynamics

## Abstract

In recent years inflation has been damping around the zero line and the issue of demographic 
change towards ever increasing life expectancy and diminishing fertility rates is receiving an increasing degree of public and scientific 
attention. This work tries to contribute to the rather scarce existing research
on the connection between demography and inflation by characterizing and
comparing the impact different age cohorts exert on inflation dynamics, each
for a sample of advanced and developing countries. The analysis is conducted
via a fixed effects regression model with a focus on robustness across different
time periods and control variables. In fact, the results indicate substantial
differences in virtue between advanced and developing countries regarding
the impact of demographic change on inflation dynamics.
